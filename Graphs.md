Graphs
what is the Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

A graph is a fundamental data structure used in computer science to represent relationships and connections between objects or entities. It consists of a set of vertices  (nodes) and a set of edges that connect these vertices. Graphs are used to model and solve various real-world problems where relationships or connections between entities need to be analyzed.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”,are the fundamental units in a graph, representing entities or objects. Each node can have a unique identifier and may contain additional information or attributes.

Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes. Edges can be directed or undirected, depending on whether they have a specific direction or not. 

Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

Directed vs Undirected

- An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

- A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
 - Complete Graph: A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.


-  A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.


- A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

Real World Uses of Graphs
Graphs are extremely popular when it comes to it’s uses. Here are just a few examples of graphs in use:

- GPS and Mapping
- Driving Directions
- Social Networks
- Airline Traffic
- Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
