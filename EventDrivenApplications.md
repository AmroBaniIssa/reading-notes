What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
    In Node.js, the native module that allows us to get started with event-driven programming is called the events module. This module provides an EventEmitter class that enables developers to create and handle custom events.

    To use the events module, you need to require it at the beginning of your Node.js script:
        const EventEmitter = require('events');


What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) and event-driven programming (EDP) are two different paradigms that can complement each other and provide various benefits when used together.

    1- Modularity and Encapsulation: OOP promotes modularity by organizing code into classes and objects. By encapsulating data and behavior within objects, you can achieve better organization and maintainability. When combined with EDP, events can be used to trigger actions or methods within objects, allowing for a modular and structured approach to handling events.
    2- Code Reusability: OOP emphasizes reusability through concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. With event-driven programming, you can reuse components and event handlers across different parts of your application. This combination allows you to create reusable classes or objects that encapsulate event handling logic and can be easily integrated into different event-driven systems.
    3- Separation of Concerns: OOP encourages the separation of concerns by dividing functionality into classes and objects. Similarly, event-driven programming promotes loose coupling by decoupling the event emitter from event listeners. This separation allows for easier maintenance and debugging, as changes in one part of the codebase do not necessarily impact the other.
    4- Scalability and Flexibility: The combination of OOP and EDP provides scalability and flexibility. OOP allows you to create modular and extensible code, while EDP allows you to handle events asynchronously and react to different events dynamically. This combination is particularly useful in applications that require handling multiple concurrent events or need to scale to handle increased event traffic.
    5- User Interface Development: EDP is commonly used in user interface development to handle user interactions and events. OOP can complement this by providing a structured approach to building user interface components. UI elements can be encapsulated within objects, and events triggered by user interactions can be handled by appropriate methods or event handlers associated with those objects.

    When used together, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Event-Driven Programming (EDP) offer several benefits. They promote modularity, code reusability, and separation of concerns. OOP enables structured design and encapsulation of data and behavior within objects, while EDP handles events and asynchronous operations. The combination allows for scalable and flexible systems, particularly useful in user interfaces, networking, and IoT applications.

Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
   
    Imagine you're running a restaurant with a large number of customers. To keep things organized and efficient, you need a system that can handle different events occurring in your restaurant, such as customers placing orders, chefs preparing meals, and waiters delivering food to tables. Event-Driven Programming (EDP) can help you achieve this.
    Now, let's bring this concept to the world of web development using Node.js on the backend. Node.js is a powerful platform that allows you to build web applications and servers. EDP in Node.js works similarly to our restaurant scenario, but instead of customers and chefs, we have different events happening within the server.

    In a web application, events can include a user submitting a form, a file being uploaded, or a database query completing. With EDP, you can write code that reacts to these events in real-time.
    Event-Driven Programming on the backend with Node.js enables efficient handling of various events, allowing your web application to respond quickly and handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It provides a structured and flexible approach to building powerful and scalable backend systems for web development.
