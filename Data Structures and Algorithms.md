What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
 One of the more important considerations when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the efficiency of operations performed on the data.
  -Accessing Elements:If frequent element access or retrieval is a primary concern, you might consider data structures like arrays or hash tables.
  -Insertion and Deletion: If the problem involves frequent insertion and deletion operations, linked lists or balanced trees (such as binary search trees or AVL trees) can be more suitable.
  -Search and Retrieval:For efficient searching and retrieval of elements, data structures like binary search trees or opjects are often favorable.
  -Ordering and Sorting: If maintaining ordering or sorting is important, structures like arrays, linked lists, or balanced trees can be appropriate.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
  Define Base Cases: Recursive functions should have one or more base cases, which are the stopping conditions that end the recursion.
